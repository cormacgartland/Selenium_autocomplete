# Selenium_autocomplete
Selenium for python automating form auto-complete and navigating multiple windows.

After cloning this repo, set up your virtual environment with venv. 
Run this command from CLI:

    python -m venv .venv <------(.venv is the folder name)
    
Open VS Code.

Open a terminal and type vert, hit tab, press enter. This runs venv (Windows definitely. Not sure about Mac or Linux)

Hit run in VS Code.

Now it does stuff on its own.
